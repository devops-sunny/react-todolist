Practical:
- You need to make a Todo App where there shall be a list of Todo List. 
- There shall be at least list of functionalities listed below.

Flow:
- Screen 1: 
        - Dashboard shall start with list of Todos & there shall be ADD button which will open up the 2nd screen.
        - There shall be EDIT button in the list for each Todo. By clicking on one, user shall be able to update that Todo.
- Screen 2:
	- Here user shall have few number of fields to get stored as a part of Todo (At least 3 fields - title, description, current date & time in 'YYYYMMDDHHmmss' format).
        - Please store the result in a global db.
	- No API calling is required anywhere (only use redux-saga/redux-thunk/Context API as global application DB).

- You can use bootstrap or any other library which is convenient to you to make a proper design & structure.
- Please share your code using your personal github account link.

Note: 
- Make sure you use redux-saga/redux-thunk/Context API to maintain global data throughout the application.
- Please keep your code clean & apply appropriate comments.
- An attractive UI will always be an advantage.
- Code optimization will be appreciated.
